      <h2>Aftercare</h2>
      <p>
        Your fresh tattoo will be wrapped with bandaging. It is
        best to leave it on until instructed which could range anywhere from a
        few hours to overnight. Wash it with water and mild soap (we recommend
        Dove Sensitive) and rinse well. Do this
        once to twice daily for about a week. 
        Apply Aquafor ointment after every cleaning for about a week.
      </p>
      <p>
        After a week or so, and once the tattoo is
        in a drier phase, switch the Aquafor out for a scentless or sensitive lotion. Keep it covered
        with clothing and do not expose it to sun, swimming, gym, animals, yard
        work, etc. <strong>Do not</strong> submerge it under water. Your tattoo
        can get very irritated if you are doing too much.
      </p>
      <p>
        If it becomes overly red, painful, or possibly infected, visit a doctor or dermatologist and feel free to call/consult us for more information.
