      <h2>Aftercare</h2>
      <p>
        In most cases, your fresh tattoo will be wrapped with bandaging. It is
        best to leave it on until instructed which could range anywhere from a
        few hours to overnight. Wash it with water and mild soap (we recommend
        Dove Sensitive) to loosen dried serum and rinse well. This may be needed
        once to twice daily for about a week.
      </p>
      <p>
        Apply Aquaphor ointment if needed or scentless lotion once the tattoo is
        in a drier phase, which is usually around day 5 or 6. Keep it covered
        with clothing and do not expose it to sun, swimming, gym, animals, yard
        work, etc. <strong>Do not</strong> submerge it under water. Your tattoo
        can get very irritated if you are doing too much.
      </p>

        If it becomes red and possibly infected, call us immediately so we can
        make sure to get you cared for.
